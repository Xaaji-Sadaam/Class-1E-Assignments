    <p>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The initial purpose of HTML was to facilitate the sharing of research documents among scientists.</p>

    <p>Over the years, HTML has evolved and become more versatile, allowing the creation of complex and interactive web pages. It provides a structure for organizing content, defining headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.</p>

    <p>With the advent of HTML5, the latest version of HTML, new features and elements were introduced, such as video and audio tags, canvas for drawing graphics, and semantic elements to improve the accessibility and search engine optimization of web pages.</p>

    <p>Today, HTML is the backbone of the World Wide Web, enabling the creation of visually appealing and accessible websites that can be accessed by people using a variety of devices, including those who are visually impaired and rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.</p>
